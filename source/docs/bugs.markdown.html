Being in Beta, you can be sure you will find bugs. You can also be sure we will fix them very quickly. If you find a bug, PLEASE report it to us. We have made this really easy to do.

In the Codio site bar, you will see an envelope icon. Click on this and you can send us a message describing any issues you find. We will also notify you of updates to the system through this. If there are unread messages, you will see an unread message count superimposed.
