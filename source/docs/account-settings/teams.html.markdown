**Paid Account Alert : ** during the Beta phase, anyone can create teams. However, once we launch in production mode, you will require a paid account to manage and use teams.

Adding a team allows you to define a group of Codio users that belong to that team. Within the IDE, you can then assign read/write/admin permissions to teams without having to assign them to individual users.

Click on the **Add Team** button to add a new team. You can then add individual users. Start typing their names and you will see them listed as you start typing. When you select a Codio user, you will see them added below the team. You can then easily remove them, too.
