Creating a new project or importing one is really easy. All you do is click on the Create Project link in the Console as shown below.

******* SS ********

You will then be shown a dialog that lets you 

- create a new blank project
- import from a Git repo
- import from a Mercurial repo
- import from a ZIP file

Be patient while the project loads. This can take a while depending on its size. Once it is loaded, it will take you directly into the IDE where you can see your project.
