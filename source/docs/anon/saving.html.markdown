When you click the save button as an anonymous user, the project is saved under the URL shown in the address bar. You should record this if you want to get to this project from any browser. 

This URL will persist and can be used in any location. You can even load the Codio IDE into an iframe.

If you have more than one project on the go then you should consider creating an account. This will let you organize your files nicely as well as manage more advanced features such as teams and private projects that are not publicly visible.
