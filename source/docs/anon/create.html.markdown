When you start Codio in anonymous mode, you will see the following screen 

************** INSERT SS ***********

Click on **Create Project** and you will be able to see the full create/import dialog. Once you complete this step, you will be taken directly into the IDE.

If you want to start with a completely blank sheet, select **Create a plain HTML web app** and then you can remove any content you don't want.
