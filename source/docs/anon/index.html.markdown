You can use Codio without an account, in which case you operate as an anonymouse user. If you are not logged in to a Codio account, you will see the following site bar at the top. You should see this sitebar when you go to the main Codio.com website.

If you click on ???? Try it ???? you can create a new project by importing or by creating a new, empty project.

When you save, a cookie will be stored on your PC, but you should be sure to note the URL of the project as this is the only other thing that will let you find the project again.

You can use this URL in any way you like.
