You can form any 3rd party public project into your account. If you are not signed in to an account then this will create a new anonymous project url and a cookie will be planted on your PC so that you can edit it in the future. However, you will only be able to edit it from the same PC and browser that was used to create it.

If you are looking at someone else's project, then it will look like this

![Fork project](/img/docs/fork-ide.png)

If you are signed into a Codio account, then forking a project will create the fork in your own account.
